>*"The easy way out is the coward's way out."*

The old adage goes: *the struggle is worth it.* Or, *there are no shortcuts in life.* Even better yet: *do what is right, not what is easy.* We seem to place a premium on the value of suffering in pursuit of a goal, on staving off short-term wants for long-term gains. And, of course, the personal development of lowered time preference is generally a net positive. 

However, one must be wary of choosing pathways for the sake of the struggle, and I posit that people have a tendency to do things not because of their higher expected value, but because they *fear* taking The Easy Way Out.

## So I Want To Drop Out... 

It seems to be a common issue among agentic individuals that they find existing institutions don't offer them positive environments (in the best case) or actively counteract their interests (in a worse case). Inevitably, this results in a search for alternatives, whether this is dropping out of school, finding alternative employment, or otherwise sacrificing stability for "fulfillment." This is almost certainly not The Easy Way Out.

In fact, most instutionalized progression tracks could be deemed The Easy Way Out, and if your modus operandi is having an impact (on anything), diminishing returns almost dictate that you adopt some sort of entreprenurial mindset to engage in creative destruction and blaze a new trail into the unknown. It's rational to escape the system!

This is (probably) valid if you're optimizing for a single outcome, but most people don't know with absolute certainty what they want out of life so they're likely optimizing for multiple different outcomes, some of which might counter each other. For instance, my desire for a social life makes high school a net positive, while for metrics which measure useful learning high school is atrocious.

However, I place more value on learning than a social life, so my naive calculus would suggest I graduate early (or something similar) and find alternative methods of schooling. But why am I aligned this way? Learning has a higher return on investment than social activity, sure. Yet learning might not make me happy (intellectualism as a catalyst for social isolation is common), and it's not quite obvious that the mismatch between my two values should be drastic.

Obviously, life-changing decisions are much more complicated than a reduction to two parameters can show, but introducing more variables to the system simply makes it harder to act rationally! As a result, we resort to heuristics to determine which values we place emphasis on over others. Institutions are local optima for some confluence of human desires, and leaving them likely has a variety of negative externalities with regards to values one doesn't actively care about. So it stands to reason that our motivation for leaving them can be boiled down to a simpler model.

## Suffering as a Heuristic

*No pain, no gain.* Effort is semi-strongly correlated with success, so choosing harder pathways in life is good. Right? Taking rigorous courses in high school improves your chances in the American college acceptance system, lifting until muscle failure is the most effective for building muscle mass (don't quote me on that), etc. Suffering is also positively correlated with effort, albeit to varying degrees, so on some level suffering can be used as a heuristic for success. Your mileage may vary.

Although, the relationship between suffering and effort is often why we resort to The Easy Way Out. Suffering bad, so minimizing suffering is good. 

Issues begin to crop up when we recognize that archetypal, impactful success stories are highly correlated with increased suffering: entrepreneurs are [four times more likely to suffer from depression](https://www.zenbusiness.com/blog/entrepreneur-depression/) than average. Higher EV outcomes are accompanied with higher risk, and when it comes to life trajectories higher risk comes hand in hand with suffering.

So it's plausible to use personal suffering as a heuristic to make choices, especially if you discount your happiness. 

## Chasing Success

I feel that a lot of young people have some sort of burning desire to change the world/do cool things, and exposing them to tangible avenues for doing so causes them to hyperfocus on it. This often comes at the cost of their own personal wellbeing, career stability, or other good things that they  undervalue because of their immaturity. (I am one of these people).

In the beginning, the will to blaze a new trail is fueled by passion, but when that passion dies new fuel is needed. The healthy way of generating fuel is convincing yourself that you enjoy whatever you're doing, but another way is reminding oneself of the dreary monotony that is "The System." Institutions are bad. They stunt growth and kill freedom. Going back to the status quo is unacceptable.

Fearing the consequences of institutionalism leads to fearing The Easy Way Out. 

Adjacent to this, ideological motivation is extremely powerful (*coughs in effective altruism.*). Aligning oneself strongly to some core principles often leads to the denial of personal happiness, and sacrifice is valued because it furthers some external goal. The Easy Way Out would be to ignore the ideological precepts and succumb to base desires, but that would be a cop out. 

The Easy Way Out is a betrayal of the value system, so avoid it at all costs.

I find that mindsets which impose obligations/duties on oneself for the sake of the greater good are drastically more likely to cause optimization towards harder, higher variance life pathways antithetical to The Easy Way Out. This is *extremely prone* to causing more suffering in life, and being aware of how your values hurt you unnecessarily is important.

It's ok to be happy.
