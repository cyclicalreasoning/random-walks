I was a member of the Harry Potter fandom long before I entered the rationalist sphere, likely having read in excess of 60 million words of HP fanfiction. Interestingly, I never found the motivation (for time surely was not lacking) to read Eliezer Yudkowsky's epic: *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*. Not because I didn't know about it—by favorites, it is the second most popular HP fanfiction on fanfiction.net—but because I found its premise offputting. There was something about an uber-smart, powerful, eleven year-old Harry Potter that I didn't want to read about, so I didn't.

Luckily, a few weeks ago my friends at ESPR (shoutout to www.uli.rocks) convinced me to give HPMOR a second chance, and it was a wild ride.

Apart from the main criticisms I had before beginning the work (an eleven year-old realistically does not have enough emotional maturity to change the world, the situations Harry solves are ridiculously contrived, the reveal that Quirrell was Voldemort was as obvious as the light of day), HPMOR surprised me with its quality and nuance. Sure, the writing style was rough at times, and the first ten chapters are moderately horrific exposition, but it was a valuable read.

Except for its usage of the scientific method.
