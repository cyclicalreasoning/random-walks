"Hello World!" is overused. 

The first lesson in every introductory programming class revolves around printing this simple statement to the terminal. 

In Python:
```
print("Hello World!")
```
In Java:
```
System.out.println("Hello World!");
```
In C++:
```
std::cout << "Hello World!";
```
In *Haskell*:
```
main :: IO()
main = putStrLn "Hello World!"
```
This may be disquieting: that the entrypoint to a field once permeated with "hacker culture" and strong anti-institutionalist vibes has been standardized for the sake of tradition.

Yet, that acceptance of "Hello World!" as a pseudo-metonym for starting something new and beginning a journey through lands unfamiliar to oneself is what also allows me to use it as the basis for my first blog post without guilt.

Hopefully, this blog will be interesting to you. I'll try to make it interesting for me.
